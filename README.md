<h1> Vulnerability Management Lab </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
 In this Lab, we're creating a Windows 10 virtual machine and using the Nessus Essentials to monitor and shows the vulnerabilities present in the operating system. Nessus Essentials show the remediation measures to follow to avoid possible vulnerabilties and configure them.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities</h2>

- <b> Oracle Virtual Box </b>
- <b> Nessus Essentials </b>

<h2>Environment</h2>

- <b> Windows 10 </b> 

<h2>Lab walk-through:</h2>

- After downloading of  windows 10 iso, and Oracle Virutal box
- Install the virtual box and windows 10 iso 
-  While setting up of the server configure it with first adapter to nat

we are using the briged network setting between the virtual machine and host operating machine

after setting up the nessus essentials, open the windows 10 - cmd - ipconfig to get the ip address of the machine.

since we are in a lab environment, to know the vulnerabilities, i'm turing off the windows defender controls to get pass.


<img width="828" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-04 at 3 54 09 PM" src="https://github.com/GiridharNaagar/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/assets/114043681/3bbac9ca-6a65-43a7-9009-eaea0f043266">


Now, in nessus essentials we are performing a basic network scan by giving the windows 10 ip address.

the results would be like but this would be a basic scan we wont know so we are going to perform a credential scan by following nessuss steps.

enabiling the remote registry so that we can scan through them

enabiling file and printer sharing

opening Registry Editor  and creating local account token filter policy, setting the value to 1

Now, we are adding our windows credentials to the credentials feild in the nessus

<img width="495" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-04 at 4 16 35 PM" src="https://github.com/GiridharNaagar/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/assets/114043681/838bdb34-21f4-4ecb-b879-624694cd7179">


and run the scan and  compare the scan results with our previous scan results

<img width="801" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-04 at 4 18 00 PM" src="https://github.com/GiridharNaagar/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/assets/114043681/54993b65-5eeb-4832-83bc-925734d73721">


as we can see there are more criticals, vulnerabilites than our previous result, we have to use credentials scan to find what really happening in the system.


<img width="512" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-04 at 4 20 29 PM" src="https://github.com/GiridharNaagar/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/assets/114043681/88248e55-9e51-4e8a-b511-51caba171853">

In remediate tab, it shows what we can do to mitigate the vulnerabilities

For more scans, for instance we are downloading the old version of firefox on the virutal machine and installing the exe file.
Then run the scan again in the nessus and find the results 


<img width="527" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-04 at 4 27 24 PM" src="https://github.com/GiridharNaagar/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/assets/114043681/129213cd-338c-4917-b8dd-3488b5601584">


<img width="361" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-04 at 4 28 13 PM" src="https://github.com/GiridharNaagar/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/assets/114043681/6684ad06-076c-4d6e-ae95-eb5248b41c5d">

The results shows that the exe files has so many vulnerabilites that can be exploited and it suggests that they should be remediated as soon as possible so to fortify the operating system

For this lab we can understand what we should to do and to mitigating them through various scanning methods.
